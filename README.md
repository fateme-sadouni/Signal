 This app should allow users to input their age and gender, then generate a personalized daily food plan based on these inputs. Here's how it should work: <br><br>
 
**User Input:** The user enters their age and selects their gender. <br>
**Data Processing:** The app uses the provided data and generates a daily food plan, suggesting specific foods and their serving sizes from different food groups (like fruits, vegetables, proteins, etc.).<br>
**Output Display:** The app displays the personalized daily plan, showing the recommended foods and portion sizes for each meal. <br>
This app aims to help users plan their meals in a healthy and balanced way according to dietary guidelines.
<br><br>
To design a React page that allows users to input their age and gender and outputs a daily food plan, we'll need to do the following steps:<br>
<br> <br>

1️⃣  **Data Analysis and Preparation:** <br>

• Understand the Data: analyze the CSV files to understand the relationship between food groups, serving sizes, and other related data.<br>
• Mapping the Data: Map out how the food groups relate to different age and genders in terms of daily servings.  
• Formulate the Logic: Use the data to create logic that suggests a daily food plan based on the input age and gender.<br><br>
2️⃣  **Set Up the React Application** <br><br>

3️⃣  **Create the Input Form:**  Create a form component that asks for the user's age and gender.<br><br>

4️⃣  **Process the Input Data:** Use the input data (age and gender) to filter relevant food groups and serving sizes. generate a daily meal plan for the user.<br>

5️⃣  **Display the Output:** <br>
•  Plan Display Component: Create a component to display the daily food plan based on the processed data.  
•  Responsive Design: Ensure the output is responsive and user-friendly  <br>

6️⃣ **Optional Enhancements:** <br>
• Customization: Allow users to customize their meal plan based on preferences or dietary restrictions. <br>

7️⃣ **Test the Application**
• Unit Testing: Test individual components and ensure the application meets user needs.<br>
