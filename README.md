7️⃣8️⃣9️⃣ <br> <br>
1️⃣  **Data Analysis and Preparation**<br>

• Understand the Data: analyze the CSV files to understand the relationship between food groups, serving sizes, and other related data.<br>
• Mapping the Data: Map out how the food groups relate to different age and genders in terms of daily servings.  
• Formulate the Logic: Use the data to create logic that suggests a daily food plan based on the input age and gender.<br><br>
2️⃣  **Set Up the React Application** <br><br>
3️⃣  **Create the Input Form:** <br><br>
4️⃣  **Process the Input Data:** Use the input data (age and gender) to filter relevant food groups and serving sizes. generate a daily meal plan for the user.<br>
5️⃣  **Display the Output:** <br>
•  Plan Display Component: Create a component to display the daily food plan based on the processed data.  
•  Responsive Design: Ensure the output is responsive and user-friendly
