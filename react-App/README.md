**Canada Foof Guide Online Service**  <br><br>
---

**Introduction**  
This is a code repository for meal planning. 
We're going to use React and Material UI.
The Government of Canada wishes to provide the Canada Food Guide as an online service to improve the health of Canadians.  
This app should allow users to input their age and gender, then generate a personalized daily food plan based on these inputs.  
The app uses the provided data (includes food groups, serving sizes, and nutritional recommendations) to determine the appropriate number of servings for each food group based on the user's age and gender.
This app aims to help users plan their meals in a healthy and balanced way according to dietary guidelines



**Setup:**  
---
run npm start for both client and server side to start the development server.
